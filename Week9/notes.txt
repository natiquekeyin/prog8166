DOM (Document Object Model)
    An API that enables HTML,CSS to talk to JavaScript and vice versa.

    DOM creates a DOM Tree within browser memory and we can manipulate the elements in that...

    DOM Tree represents the html elements in an upside down tree with html being the root...
    
 Steps in DOM programming:
    1. Finding refernce to the elements:
     document.body etc... IT IS VERY GENERAL
     a. getElementById(id)
     b. querySelector(selector) & querySelectorAll(selector)
        selector can be: i) Tag name, ii) ID, iii) Class
    2. Creating and embedding new elements:
        createElement() that creates a new element...
    3. Changing/altering the contents or attributes of the elements...

    4. Run code in response to the events triggered by user, browser or other code...


Objects in JavaScript:

let y=[1,2,3];


let obj = { };

let obj2={ name:"Alan Smith",age:20,email:"alan@gmail.com" }
